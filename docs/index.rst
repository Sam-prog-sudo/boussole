Welcome to Boussole's documentation!
====================================

Aims to reproduce the useful Compass commandline tool behavior for 'build' and 'watch' actions.

This is under construction, not even an Alpha for now.

Old SASS syntax (the *indented syntax*) is not totally supported and actually this is not really planned to do it.
